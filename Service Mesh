A **Service Mesh** is a dedicated infrastructure layer that manages **service-to-service communication** in a **microservices architecture**. 
It handles things like **traffic routing, service discovery, load balancing, security (like mTLS), observability (tracing, logging), and fault tolerance** ‚Äî all **without requiring changes to application code**.

---

### üîß How It Works:

A service mesh typically uses **sidecar proxies** (e.g., Envoy) that are **deployed alongside each service instance**. These proxies intercept and manage all network traffic between services.

### üéØ Key Features:

1. **Traffic Management**:

   * Intelligent routing, retries, timeouts
   * Canary releases, blue-green deployments

2. **Security**:

   * Mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service encryption
   * Fine-grained access control

3. **Observability**:

   * Distributed tracing
   * Metrics and logs for visibility

4. **Resilience**:

   * Circuit breakers
   * Failover and retry policies

### üß± When to Use a Service Mesh:

Use it if you:

* Have many microservices interacting with each other
* Need fine-grained control over service communication
* Want security, observability, and reliability built into your communication stack

Avoid it if:

* You have a simple monolith or few services
* You're not ready for the complexity it adds
