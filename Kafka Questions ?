Here are commonly asked Apache Kafka interview questions, organized by difficulty level and topic area:

### ðŸ”¹ Basic Kafka Interview Questions

1. What is Apache Kafka?
- Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform used to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. 
- It is designed to handle high-throughput, low-latency, fault-tolerant data transmission across distributed systems.
- Apache Kafka is like a messaging system where different applications can send (produce) and receive (consume) data (messages) in real-time â€” much like a publish-subscribe system.

Core Features
1.High throughput â€“ Handles millions of messages per second.
2.Scalability â€“ Horizontally scalable by adding brokers.
3.Durability â€“ Data is persisted to disk.
4.Fault tolerance â€“ Replication across brokers ensures availability.
5.Real-time processing â€“ Supports stream processing via Kafka Streams.

Key Components
1.Producer â€“ Sends (publishes) messages to Kafka topics.
2.Consumer â€“ Reads messages from Kafka topics.
3.Topic â€“ A logical channel to which producers send and consumers read messages.
4.Broker â€“ A Kafka server that stores and manages messages.
5.Partition â€“ A topic is divided into partitions for scalability and parallelism.
6.Zookeeper â€“ Coordinates the Kafka brokers (metadata, leader election). (Optional in newer versions with KRaft mode)

Typical Use Cases
1.Real-time analytics and monitoring (e.g., website activity tracking)
2.Log aggregation (e.g., centralized log systems)
3.Event sourcing and CQRS
4.Messaging backbone between microservices
5.Stream processing pipelines (via Kafka Streams or Apache Flink)

2. What are the main components of Kafka?




3. What is a Kafka topic and partition?
4. What is the role of Zookeeper in Kafka?
5. What is a Kafka producer and consumer?
6. How does Kafka ensure message durability?
7. What is the difference between Kafka and traditional messaging systems like RabbitMQ or ActiveMQ?
8. How do Kafka consumers read data?
9. What is a consumer group in Kafka?
10. How does Kafka handle message retention?

2. How does Kafka handle backpressure?
3. What are idempotent producers in Kafka?
4. What is the role of Kafka Connect?
5. How do you secure a Kafka cluster?

   * SSL, SASL, ACLs
6. What is the use of Kafka Schema Registry?
7. How does Kafka guarantee order of messages?
8. How do you implement transactional messaging in Kafka?
9. How do you perform Kafka cluster rebalancing?
10. Describe Kafka internal storage format.

### ðŸ”¹ Scenario-Based Kafka Questions

1. How would you design a Kafka-based system to process millions of messages per second?
2. What would you do if consumers are falling behind the producer rate?
3. How to handle message replay in Kafka?
4. Your Kafka consumer keeps getting duplicate messages â€” how would you debug and fix it?
5. Describe a time you handled a Kafka cluster upgrade.
