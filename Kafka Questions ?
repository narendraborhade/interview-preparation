Here are commonly asked Apache Kafka interview questions, organized by difficulty level and topic area:

### ðŸ”¹ Basic Kafka Interview Questions

1. What is Apache Kafka?
- Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform used to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. 
- It is designed to handle high-throughput, low-latency, fault-tolerant data transmission across distributed systems.
- Apache Kafka is like a messaging system where different applications can send (produce) and receive (consume) data (messages) in real-time â€” much like a publish-subscribe system.

Core Features
1.High throughput â€“ Handles millions of messages per second.
2.Scalability â€“ Horizontally scalable by adding brokers.
3.Durability â€“ Data is persisted to disk.
4.Fault tolerance â€“ Replication across brokers ensures availability.
5.Real-time processing â€“ Supports stream processing via Kafka Streams.

Key Components
1.Producer â€“ Sends (publishes) messages to Kafka topics.
2.Consumer â€“ Reads messages from Kafka topics.
3.Topic â€“ A logical channel to which producers send and consumers read messages.
4.Broker â€“ A Kafka server that stores and manages messages.
5.Partition â€“ A topic is divided into partitions for scalability and parallelism.
6.Zookeeper â€“ Coordinates the Kafka brokers (metadata, leader election). (Optional in newer versions with KRaft mode)

Typical Use Cases
1.Real-time analytics and monitoring (e.g., website activity tracking)
2.Log aggregation (e.g., centralized log systems)
3.Event sourcing and CQRS
4.Messaging backbone between microservices
5.Stream processing pipelines (via Kafka Streams or Apache Flink)

2. What are the main components of Kafka?

1. Producer
* Sends (publishes) data (messages/events) to Kafka topics.
* Pushes data to a specific topic.
* Can choose the partition based on a key (for ordering) or let Kafka decide.
* Can be asynchronous or synchronous.

2. Consumer
* Reads data from Kafka topics.
* Works in consumer groups to enable parallel processing.
* Each partition is read by only one consumer in a group (load balancing).
* Tracks its position using offsets.

3. Topic
* A named stream of records/messages.
* Data is categorized and stored in topics.
* Topics are divided into partitions for scalability and parallelism.

4. Partition
* Each topic is split into one or more partitions.
* Messages within a partition are ordered.
* Allows Kafka to scale horizontally across brokers.
* Partitions are the unit of parallelism in Kafka.

5. Broker
* A Kafka server that stores data and serves clients.
* Each broker handles multiple topic-partitions.
* A Kafka cluster consists of multiple brokers.
* One broker acts as a leader for a partition; others are replicas.

6. Zookeeper (Deprecated in newer versions, replaced by KRaft mode)
* Used for cluster coordination, configuration, and leader election.
* Manages metadata and broker health.
* In Kafka 2.8+ and later, KRaft mode (Kafka Raft) removes dependency on Zookeeper.

7. Consumer Group
* A group of consumers working together to consume messages from a topic.
* Ensures scalable and fault-tolerant consumption.
* Each partition is assigned to only one consumer within the group.

8. Leader and Follower (Replication)
* Each partition has one leader and multiple followers.
* The leader handles all reads and writes.
* Followers replicate the data for high availability.


3. What is a Kafka topic and partition?
A Kafka topic is like a category or feed name to which records (messages) are sent by producers and from which they are read by consumers.
* Think of it as a channel where messages are published and subscribed.
* You can have multiple producers and multiple consumers for a single topic.
Example: A topic named `"user-signups"` could store all new user registration events.

What is a Partition?
A partition is a sub-division of a topic. Each topic can be split into multiple partitions to allow parallelism and scalability.

Each partition:
* Is an ordered sequence of messages.
* Stores messages with an offset (unique ID).
* Is stored on a Kafka broker.
* Has one leader (for read/write) and zero or more replicas (for fault tolerance).

Messages within a partition are always in the same order they were written.
Example:
Suppose you have a topic:
Topic: orders
Partitions: 3 (P0, P1, P2)
Kafka will distribute incoming messages across the 3 partitions. For example:

| Message | Partition |
| ------- | --------- |
| Order1  | P0        |
| Order2  | P1        |
| Order3  | P2        |
| Order4  | P0        |

Why Use Partitions?
* Scalability: Allows Kafka to distribute load across multiple brokers.
* Parallelism: Multiple consumers can read in parallel.
* Performance: Better throughput for both producers and consumers.

Summary Table:

| Concept   | Description                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Topic     | Logical stream of messages            |
| Partition | Physical storage unit within a topic  |
| Offset    | Unique ID of a message in a partition |
| Broker    | Kafka server storing topic partitions |
