Rate limiting in microservices is a strategy used to control the number of requests a user, service, or client can make to a particular microservice in a given time window. 
It is essential for ensuring system stability, fair resource usage, and preventing abuse or overuse.

Why Use Rate Limiting?

Prevent DDoS attacks or abusive clients
Ensure fair usage across multiple consumers
Protect backend services and databases from overload
Maintain SLAs (Service Level Agreements)

Common Rate Limiting Algorithms

| Algorithm          | Description                                                                  | Use Case                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Fixed Window   | Limits requests in a fixed time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute)       | Simple APIs                |
| Sliding Window | Allows a smoother distribution by considering requests over a rolling window | More accurate rate control |
| Token Bucket   | Tokens are added at a fixed rate; each request consumes a token              | Bursty traffic is allowed  |
| Leaky Bucket   | Queues requests and processes them at a fixed rate                           | Smooths out bursts         |

### ðŸ”§ How to Implement Rate Limiting

#### 1. At API Gateway Level

 Use tools like:

   Kong
   NGINX
   AWS API Gateway
   Envoy Proxy / Istio (in service mesh)
 Example in Kong:

  ```yaml
  plugins:
    - name: rate-limiting
      config:
        minute: 100
        policy: local
  ```

#### 2. At Application Level

 Implement using in-memory stores like Redis.
 Example: Using a token bucket algorithm in Java or Python.
 Java libraries: Bucket4j, Resilience4j

#### 3. Distributed Rate Limiting

 Use centralized stores like Redis, Memcached for shared counters.
 Ideal for load-balanced or horizontally scaled systems.

### âš™ Example with Redis (Python Pseudocode)

```python
if redis.get(user_id) >= LIMIT:
    return "429 Too Many Requests"
else:
    redis.incr(user_id)
    redis.expire(user_id, 60)  # reset every 60 seconds
```

### ðŸ“Š Best Practices

 Use exponential backoff + retries on the client side
 Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., `429 Too Many Requests`)
 Include rate limit headers (`X-RateLimit-Remaining`)
 Allow different limits for different users (e.g., paid vs free)
